# Sales Transactions Data Visualied

In the [Data Wrangling](https://github.com/sarthakbatragatech/100-Days-of-ML/tree/master/Data-Wrangling) and [Time-Series Forecasting](https://github.com/sarthakbatragatech/100-Days-of-ML/tree/master/Time-Series-Forecasting) section, I dealt with sales transactions data from the Russian software company, 1C. The notebooks in those sections perform a little EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis) on the dataset and in this standalone notebook, I will create a few visualizations/charts with the general context in mind.

## The Dataset
